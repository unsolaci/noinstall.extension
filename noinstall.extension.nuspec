      Helper functions to remove package from Chocolatey installed packages,
      which allow you to execute Chocolatey package scripts without marking
      package as installed.

      I wrote this extension with a very specific use case in mind, i.e. when
      you want Chocolatey to run the package install scripts, but do **not**
      want Chocolatey to treat the package as _installed_.

      I use is for internal packages which aren't really software installers,
      but rather scripts that are just supposed to run, possibly periodically.

      ## Usage:
      ```
      Remove-ChocolateyPackageFromChocolatey -PackageName PACKAGE_NAME
      ```
